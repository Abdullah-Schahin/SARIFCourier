## ‚ú® What is SARIF Courier?

SARIF Courier is a GitHub Action that takes a SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) report and posts a beautifully formatted summary as a comment on your Pull Requests. This enables you to surface security and static analysis findings in your PR workflow, even if you do not have access to GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS).

- **No GHAS required:** Works for all repositories, public or private.
- **Instant feedback:** See security and code analysis results right in your PRs.
- **Easy integration:** Just drop the action in your workflow and point it to your SARIF file.

```yaml
- name: Render SARIF in PR
  uses: Abdullah-Schahin/SARIFCourier@v1
  with:
    sarif_file: path/to/your-report.sarif
```

- `sarif_file` (**required**): Path to the SARIF file to process (relative to the workspace).
