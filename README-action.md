**Render SARIF Security Reports directly in your Pull Requests ‚Äì no GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) required!**

## ‚ú® What is SARIF Courier?

SARIF Courier is a GitHub Action that takes a SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) report and posts a beautifully formatted summary as a comment on your Pull Requests. This enables you to surface security and static analysis findings in your PR workflow, even if you do not have access to GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS).

- **No GHAS required:** Works for all repositories, public or private.
- **Instant feedback:** See security and code analysis results right in your PRs.
- **Easy integration:** Just drop the action in your workflow and point it to your SARIF file.

## üí° Why SARIF Courier?

- **Universal:** Works with any SARIF-compliant tool (CodeQL, Semgrep, ESLint, etc).
- **No vendor lock-in:** No need for GHAS or paid features.
- **Fast feedback:** Developers see issues before merging.

## üö¶ Usage

### üîë Required Environment Variables & Permissions

- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Provided automatically by GitHub Actions. Used to post comments on PRs.
  - **Permissions required:**
    - `contents: write` (to create/update comments)

No additional secrets or configuration are needed.
